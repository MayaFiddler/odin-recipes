    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil.</li>
        <li>Garlic.</li>
        <li>Fresh lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Heavy/whipping cream.</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Dried oregano.</li>
        <li>Paprika.</li>   
        <li>Chicken breasts. Chicken breasts cook quickly but chicken thighs can also be used. Cooking time will need to be adjusted though.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to make it</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the chicken:</b> Place skinless, boneless chicken breasts in between two layers of parchment paper
                 and flatten out to approximately 1cm/half inch with a rolling pin/meat mallet. 
                 Drizzle olive oil over the chicken and season with oregano, paprika, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Cook the chicken and make the sauce:</b> Heat a large frying pan over high heat. 
                Add the chicken and allow to brown on both sides for 1-2 minute or until they are golden brown on both 
                sides. Tip: If the chicken sticks, leave it for a little while longer. The chicken will release from the
                pan once itâ€™s formed a golden crust. Once the chicken is browned on both sides, remove from the pan and
                set aside. Add a tablespoon of oil to the pan and then the garlic. Cook for 30 seconds then pour in
                the cream and lemon juice. Simmer gently for 2-3 minutes. Add the Parmesan and season with salt and 
                pepper. Add the chicken back into the pan and allow to cook for a few minutes until the chicken is 
                cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>
            <li><b>Serve</b> the chicken with cooked pasta or side dishes of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
