        <li>12 large frozen shrimp (peeled, deveined, and butterflied)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil (divided)</li>
        <li>2 eggs (beaten)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (chopped)</li>
        <li>4 ounces char siu (Chinese Roast Pork) (can substitute Virginia ham or Chinese Sausage/traditional 
            sweet Lop Cheung)</li>
        <li>3 dried red chili peppers</li>
        <li>9 ounces napa cabbage (shredded, about 3 cups)</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot (about 2.5 ounces/70g)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (can substitute dry cooking sherry)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons curry powder or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make it</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>    Rehydrate the rice noodles either by soaking in cold water overnight, 
            soaking in hot water for at least 30 minutes, or boiling for 1 minute 
            (check package instructions before boiling).
        <li>Drain the noodles in a colander just before you’re ready to cook. 
        It’s ok if the noodles aren’t completely dry. 
        Use kitchen shears to cut the long strands into 8-10 inch lengths, so they are easier to stir-fry and eat.</li>
        <li>On to the shrimp. We call for a dozen large shrimp in this recipe. 
        You can also use a larger quantity of smaller shrimp if you like, as long as it’s about 6-8 ounces/170-225g. 
        Peel the shrimp, butterfly them from the back, and de-vein. Rinse and pat dry before cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat your wok over medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon of oil. 
            Add the eggs, and when they’ve cooked and bubbled along the sides, flip them over. 
            Break the egg up into rough strips with your wok spatula. Remove from the wok and set aside. </li>
    </ol>
