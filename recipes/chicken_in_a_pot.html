    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp butter total</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp olive oil total</li>
            <li>1 3-4 lb chicken grain fed, air chilled</li>
            <li>1 large or 2 medium leeks white portion only, cut into 4 inch lengths and quartered</li>
            <li>4 large shallots</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>4 carrots cut into 4 inch pieces</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>  
        </ul>
    <h3>How to make it</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 375F.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 Tbsp each of olive oil and butter over medium heat in a dutch oven large enough to hold the chicken and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Rub the chicken with olive oil then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Brown the chicken thoroughly, regulating the heat to prevent burning. This will take 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the dutch oven, discard the fat and wipe out the pot.</li>
            <li> Melt the remaining 1 Tbsp each of olive oil and butter.</li>
            <li>Add the aromatics and a good pinch of salt. Salt is critical at this point but you need to be careful not to oversalt at the same time.</li>
            <li>Return the chicken to the pot. Place a piece of aluminum foil over the pot and then cover with the lid.</li>
            <li>Roast for about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the pot and place the pot with vegetables and accumulated juices over medium heat to reduce slightly. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.</li>
            <li>Carve the chicken into quarters - 2 legs, 2 breasts. Mound a portion of the vegetables in the middle of the plate. Add a few spoonfuls of the sauce and top with chicken.</li>
            <li>Cornichons, dijon mustard and salt are the traditional accompaniments to real poule au pot. They work well here as well.</li>
